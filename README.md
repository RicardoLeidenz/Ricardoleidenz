Hi there 👋 I’m Ricardo a software developer who loves turning ideas into real, working code — whether that’s building indie games, crafting clean web pages, or experimenting with new tools just to learn something cool.

**I write code in :** **Python**, **C#**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and** C++**. I enjoy applying those skills across different areas — from implementing game mechanics to building responsive, user-friendly websites.

I’m always eager to collaborate on software 💻 and game development 🎮 projects — whether it’s building something from scratch or contributing to an existing idea. Let’s connect 🤝 and explore how we can create something great together 🚀.
